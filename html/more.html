          <div><p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am a husler, i grind so much to put food on my table, i am self-reliance, i ask questions for clarification, i am consisted in anything i do, of course i am not the best, i am not even perfect but i try my best to push things forward, i believed in the saying that says that <strong>Mmaduaburochukwu</strong> because God's time is the best, anyone that has God lacks nothing. God is the greatest, i want to use this medium and thank my able master, mentor,brother and a friend, i pray that as you are building me to become somebody in future, God will replenish your bank, you will never lack anything. Amen to your secret prayings, sound health, long life and prosperity in Jesus name. Amen. I asked for Gods protection, Wisdom and understanding from God and strongly believed that it is granted</p>
