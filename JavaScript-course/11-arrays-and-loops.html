  <!-- Arrays is another type of value that represents a list of other values, arrays itself is also value and can be saved in a variable, examples below -->
  
  <script>
/*
    const myArray = [10, 20, 30];
    console.log(myArray);
    <!-- To get a specific value in an array use [], we can access a value in the array using a index number from 0 up, example below -->
    console.log(myArray[0]);
    <!-- we can change the array value using [] =; example below -->
    myArray[0] = 99;
    console.log(myArray);
    <!-- To create an array: 1. start with open square bracket [ and we end with a close square bracket ], inside [] we can put a list of values and we separate each value with a comma, we can also write arrays in a multiple lines, separating each value with a comma,. To get a value inside an array we use [] and a number (0 up) in line 14. Index represents the position of a value in an array starting from 0 indexed array. Inside of an array we can put a type of value in line 20, array is also a value. An array is an object(in line 21) but special type of object. Arrays have properties and methods we can use like .length in line 24. Another is .push() which adds a value to the end of the array in line 25, also .splice() removes a value from an array in line 28 -->
    
    [1, 'hello', true, { names: 'socks' }, [1, 2]];

    console.log(Array.isArray([1, 2])); <!-- checking if the value is truly an array and it is -->
    
    console.log(myArray.length); <!-- tells us how many value are in the array -->
    myArray.push(100);
    console.log(myArray);
    
    myArray.splice(0, 2);
    console.log(myArray);

    <!-- Loops let us run some code over and over, it also creates a scope {}, Two types of Loops are while and for loops, examples below -->
    <!-- let i = 1;  we create a variable i, and make it = 1 and then we do a loop, so if the condition is true, the computer will keep running the code under over and over, but if false it will stop running -->
   <!-- while (1 < 5) {
     <!-- console.log(i); -->
    <!--  i++;  increment step, without it the loop will keep on going (infinite) -->
   <!-- }  This code after = {} is called iteration --> 
    
    <!-- After the for loops, 1. we add loop variable inside the bracket(), semi-colon separates each one, then 2. the loops condition and 3. lastly the increment step. and is just a shorter(shorcut) form to while -->
    for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    } <!-- it will keep on running until the variable is greater or equal to 5, then it will stop running. -->
    
    <!-- while vs for loop: standard loop use for, not standard loop use while example of non standard loop is below and it has no loop that will be increased and it has no increment step. -->

    <!-- Those code above actually give a reference to whr something is stored in the computers memory and its called copy by reference, also the code in line 84 & will pop up same output in the console.log -->
    
    <!-- Get the first and the second value from this array below using the shortcut - destructuring -->
    const [firstValue, secondValue] = [1, 2, 3];
    console.log(firstValue);
    console.log(secondValue);
